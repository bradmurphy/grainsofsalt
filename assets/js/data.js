    advice1: "Actually, I don’t think print is even a factor anymore. Long copy, short copy, or no copy. To us, print is a dead medium.",

    name2: "Tony Granger",
    title2: "Global CCO, Y&R NY",
    advice2: "Print is still relevant. Television is still relevant. The 30-second spot is still thriving. Magazine, newspaper, radio ads are still produced every day. New media hasn’t killed the old at all.",

    advice2: "For a student to come in and have a book full of billboards and 30-second TV ads shows that they’re not really living in the real world.",

    name2: "Greg Bell",
    title2: "Founder, Venables, Bell & Partners",
    advice2: "If you have somebody that bills themselves as an art director yet they also include a separate design portfolio, you think, ‘You know what? They are really a designer. They’re putting that in because they know they’re not that good as an art director.’",

    advice1: "I personally do not want to see fiction writing or screenplays or art - that doesn’t do anything for me. If it’s advertising-related work, like guerilla, alternative-type things…yeah, but as far as your hobby, writing, painting, or poetry, no.",

    advice2: "I heard of one guy who got hired, I think at Wieden, who worked for a skate shop and all he did was make really dumb, funny videos of skaters. That conveyed so much more about the guy than a traditional portfolio. I don’t see this often enough.",

    name2: "George Lois",
    title2: "Designer, Author, Ad-Legend",
    advice2: "Never listen to music when you’re trying to come up with a big idea. Especially if you’re a music lover. Music you consider great is involving and transformative, carrying you away - someplace you don’t want to be when you need to solve a specific problem with a communicative idea.",

    name2: "Greg Bell",
    title2: "Founder, Venables",
    advice2: "It’s such a cliché for a creative director to say, “It can be on a napkin if it’s a great idea!” Yeah, maybe when you’ve already got a job!",

    name2: "Andrew Keller",
    title2: "Partner CCO, CP+B Boulder",
